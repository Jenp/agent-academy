# 🚨 Mission 11: Publish Your Agent

## 🕵️‍♂️ CODENAME: `OPERATION PUBLISH PUBLISH PUBLISH`

> **⏱️ Operation Time Window:** `~30 minutes`  

## 🎯 Mission Brief

After completing a series of challenging modules, Agent Maker, you are now ready for your most critical step yet: publishing your agent. It’s time to make your creation available to users across Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 Copilot.

Your agent—equipped with a clear mission, powerful tools, and access to key knowledge sources—is ready to serve. Using Microsoft Copilot Studio, you’ll deploy your agent so it can start assisting real users, right where they work.

Let’s launch your agent into action.

## 🚀 Publish an agent

Every time you work on an agent in Copilot Studio you might update it by adding knowledge or tools. When you are ready with all the changes, and you have tested thoroughly, you are ready to publish it. Publishing ensures that the latest updates will be live. So, this means that when you update your agent with new tools, and you don't hit the publish button, it's not available yet for end users.

Make sure to always hit the publish button when you want to push the updates to the users of your agent. You agent might have channels added to it and when you hit publish the updates will be available for all the channels you added to the agent.

## ⚙️ Configure channels

Channels are places where your agent appears. The connection steps are different for each channel. For more information, see the article for the desired channels, in the following list:
