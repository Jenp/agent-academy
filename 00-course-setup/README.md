# Course Setup

We are very excited for you to start this course and learn how to build your first agent with Copilot Studio!

To help you get started, this page outlines the technical requirements and steps needed to get an environment up and running so you can start building.

1. Configuring your Microsoft 365 tenant for Copilot Studio  
1. (Optional) Obtaining a Microsoft 365 Copilot license (required to publish agents into Copilot chat)  
1. Accessing Copilot Studio and verifying your environment

## Step 1: Get a Microsoft 365 Account

Copilot Studio resides within Microsoft 365, so you need a Microsoft 365 account to access it. You can either use an existing account if you have one or follow these steps to get an appropriate license:

1. **Acquire a Paid Microsoft 365 Business Subscription**  
   1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 Business Plans and Pricing Page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-365-plans-and-pricing) 
   1. The cheapest option to get you started is the Microsoft 365 Business Basic plan. Select `Try for free` and walk through the guided form to fill in your subscription and account details and payment information.

   1. Once you have your new account, login. 

> **Tip:** If you plan to publish agents into Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat or connect to organizational data (SharePoint, OneDrive, Dataverse), a Microsoft 365 Copilot license is required. This is an add-on license which you can learn more about [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot#plans)

## Step 2: Start a Copilot Studio Trial

1. Navigate to [aka.ms/TryCopilotStudio](https://aka.ms/TryCopilotStudio).  
1. Enter the email address from the new account you configured in the previous step and select `Next`.

> **Trial Notes:**

> 1. You will receive email notifications about your trial expiration. You can extend the trial in 30-day increments (up to 90 days of agent runtime).  
> 1. If your tenant administrator disabled self-service sign-up, you’ll see an error—contact your Microsoft 365 admin to re-enable it.

Congratulations—you now have a working Microsoft 365 developer environment with Copilot Studio access. You’re ready to start building, testing, and publishing AI agents for Microsoft 365!
