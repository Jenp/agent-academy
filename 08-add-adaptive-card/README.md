### ‚ú® Use case

**As an** employee

**I want to** request a device

**So that I** can request a device from the list of available devices

Let's begin!

### Prerequisites

1. **SharePoint list**

    We'll be using the **Devices** SharePoint list from [Lesson 00 - Course Setup - Step 3: Create new SharePoint site](/00-course-setup/README.md/#step-3-create-new-sharepoint-site). 
    
    If you have not set up the **Devices** SharePoint list, please head back to [Lesson 00 - Course Setup - Step 3: Create new SharePoint site](/00-course-setup/README.md/#step-3-create-new-sharepoint-site).

1. **Contoso Helpdesk Copilot**

    We're going to use the same agent created previously in [Lesson 06 - Create a custom agent using natural language with Copilot and grounding it with your data](/06-create-agent-from-conversation/README.md).

### 8.1 Add an adaptive card to display available devices

1. In the **Available devices** topic delete the **Send a message** node that contains the JSON response of the _Get items_ SharePoint connector action in the body of the message.
