# Introduction

## What is a Topic?

A topic is a structured conversation that helps your agent respond to specific user questions or tasks. Think of a topic as a mini-conversation or task that your agent can handle. Each topic is designed to respond to a specific user question or request.

For example:

If a user asks, _“What are your business hours?”_, the agent triggers a topic called Business Hours.
If a user says, “I need help with my order,” the agent triggers a topic called Order Help.

There are three common purposes for topics based on what users need:

**Informational** - answers questions such as the following:
- “What is …?”
- “When will …?”
- “Why …?”

**Task completion** - helps users _do_ something:
- “I want to …”
- “How do I …?”

**Troubleshooting** - solves problems:
- “Something isn’t working …”
- “I'm encountering an error message …”

You can also create topics for ambiguous questions like “I need help,” which ask users for more details before continuing.

## Why are topics useful?

## Anatomy of a topic
