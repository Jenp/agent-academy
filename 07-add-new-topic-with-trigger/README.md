# Introduction

## ü§î What is a Topic?

A topic is a structured conversation that helps your agent respond to specific user questions or tasks. Think of a topic as a mini-conversation or task that your agent can handle. Each topic is designed to respond to a specific user question or request.

### üåå Purpose of a topic
There are three common purposes for topics based on what users need:

**Informational** - answers questions such as the following:
- <samp>"What is ‚Ä¶?"</samp>
- <samp>"When will ‚Ä¶?"</samp>
- <samp>"Why ‚Ä¶?"</samp>

**Task completion** - helps users _do_ something:
- <samp>"I want to ‚Ä¶"</samp>
- <samp>"How do I ‚Ä¶?"</samp>

**Troubleshooting** - solves problems:
- <samp>"Something isn‚Äôt working ‚Ä¶"</samp>
- <samp>"I'm encountering an error message ‚Ä¶"</samp>

You can also create topics for ambiguous questions like "<samp>I need help</samp>," which ask users for more details before continuing.

## üê¶ Why are topics useful?
Topics help you

- Organize your agent's knowledge

- Make conversations feel natural

- Solve user problems effeciently

## ü™∫ Types of topics

1. **System Topics** - these are built-in and handle common event such as:
    - Starting a conversation
    - Ending a conversation
    - Handling errors
    - Asking users to sign in
    - Escalating to a human agent

1. **Custom topics** - you create these two handle specific tasks or questions such as:
    - Submit a user's vacation leave request
    - <samp>I can't log in through our company VPN</samp>
    - <samp>How do office visitors connect to our company guest WiFi?</samp>

##  üß¨Anatomy of a topic

Each topic usually contains the following.

### üó£Ô∏èTriger phrases

These are words or sentences users might say to start the topic.

**Examples:**

For a vacation leave topic, trigger phrases could be

- <samp>"I want to take vacation leave"</samp>
- <samp>"Request vacation"</samp>
- <samp>"Apply for time off"</samp>
- <samp>"How do I submit a leave request?"</samp>

For a business hours topic, trigger phrases could be
- <samp>"What are your business hours?"</samp>
- <samp>"What time do you open and close today?"</samp>
- <samp>"When do you open?"</samp>

### üí¨ Conversation nodes

A topic is made up of nodes which are steps the agent follows once the topic is triggered. You connect these steps to build a flow that your agent follows when interacting with users.

Think of these as instructions or actions such as the following:

- Asking the user questions
- Sending messages
- Calling an external service such as leave management system
- Setting or checking variables
- Using conditions to branch the conversation
- Directing to another topic

The following are the main types of nodes you can add to an agent:

1. **Message node**
    - **Purpose** - sends a mesage to the user.
    - **Example** - <samp>"Thanks for your request! I'll help you with that."</samp>

1. **Question node**
    - **Purpose** - asks the user a question and waits for their answer.
    - **Example** - <samp>"What are your vacation dates?"</samp>

1. **Adaptive Card node**
    - **Purpose** - send a rich, interactive card using JSON
    - **Example** - a card that displays a calendar date picker for a user to select a date

1. **Condition node**
    - **Purpose** - add logic to the conversation. It checks something and decides what to do next.
    - **Example** - if the user says "<samp>Yes</samp>," go to the next step. If "<samp>No</samp>," end the conversation.

1. **Variable management node**
    - **Purpose** - moves the conversation to another topic or end it.
    - **Example** - save the date the user selected in the Adaptive card node.

1. **Topic managmeent node**
    - **Purpose** - moves the converation to another topic of ends it.
    - **Example** - redirect to a "Leave Policy" topic

1. **Call a Toll node**
    - **Purpose** - connects to external tools such as Power Automate, Excel, ServiceNow
    - **Example** - Power Automate cloud flow executed after user submits their vacation leave request

1. **Generative answers node**
    - **Purpose** - uses a large language model to generate natural, human-like responses based on the user's question and any connected data
    - **Example** - uses the connected knowledge source that contains information on vacation leave entitlements to answer user questions regarding vacation requests

1. **HTTP request node**
    - **Purpose** - connect your agent to external systems by sending API calls (for example `GET` or `POST`) to fetch or update data
    - **Example** - when a user asks for their vacaction days balance, the agent performs a `GET` request to the leave management system and extracts the `remainingLeaveDays` from the API response and replies to the user with the value.

1. **Event or activity node**
    - **Purpose** - lets your agent send non-message actions, such as system updates or tool triggers - to the client or channel, helping it perform tasks
    - **Example** - reacting to a user joining a chat by displaying a welcome a message

## üë©üèª‚Äçüé® OK, how do I design topics for my agent?

### üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Step 1 - understand what users need

Start by identifying common questions or tasks users will ask your agent. These could be:

- Questions that users ask often such as <samp>what's my entitlement for sick days?</samp>
- Common tasks users want to complete such as submitting a form
- Problems users often face such as login issues

### üì¶ Step 2 - Group the scenarios

Organise the user needs into three categories based on what we learnt earlier - the purposes of a topic

- Informational - the user wants to know something
- Task completion - the user wants to do something
- Troubleshooting - the user needs help with resolving an issue

### üó∫Ô∏è Step 3 - Map out the conversation

Sketch a simple conversation flow of how the agent should respond

- Start with a greeting or confirmation
- Ask follow-up questions to get details
- Provide answers or perform actions

> Tip: keep the conversation short and focused. Only ask what's necessary.

### üîÄ Step 4 - Handle different conversation types

Design for both:

- **Single-turn** - one question, one answer

- **Multi-turn** - a back and forth conversation with follow-up questions

Example:

- User: <samp>"I want to apply for vacation leave."</samp>

- Agent: <samp>"Sure! What date would you like your leave to start?"</samp>

- User: <samp>"July 15th."</samp>

- Agent: <samp>"Got it. And when will your leave end?"</samp>

- User: <samp>"July 22nd."</samp>

- Agent: <samp>"Thanks! What‚Äôs the reason for your leave??"</samp>

- User: <samp>"Family vacation."</samp>

- Agent: <samp>"Thanks for the details. I‚Äôve submitted your leave request from July 15th to July 22nd for a family vacation. You‚Äôll get a confirmation soon."

### ü§ñ Step 5 - Use AI for unexpected questions

Even if you've designed a topic for vacation leave requests, users might ask questions that aren't directly covered. This is where AI features like the Conversational boosting system topic come in handy. 

This topic includes a generative answers node, which lets your agent start using connected knowledge sources right away. Any knowledge sources added at the agent level are automatically included in the generative answers node within the Conversational Boosting system topic.

Example:

- User: <samp>"Can I carry over unused vacation days to next year?"</samp>

This question might not be part of your predefined topic flow, especially if your topic only handles submitting leave requests.

How AI helps:

If your agent is connected to your company's HR policy documents or internal website, AI can:

- Search for the relevant leave policy
- Understand and summarize the rules
- Agent responds with: <samp>"According to the HR policy, you can carry over unused vacation days to the next calendar year. For more details, check the leave policy section on the HR portal."</samp>

Why this is useful
- You don't need to manually create a topic for every policy-related question.
- AI can pull accurate answers from trusted knowledge sources.
- It improves user experience by making the agent feel smarter and more responsive.

### üî¨ Step 6 - Test the topic, the conversation flow

Before publishing your topic:

- Test using real questions or real sample inputs
- Make sure it sounds natural and helpful

> Tip: Apply improvements to your topic accordingly as you test, such as adding more nodes or removing nodes in-place of redirecting to another topic

### ‚ö†Ô∏è STep 7 - Avoid duplicating website content

Don't copy what's already on your website

- Focus on topics that users ask about often
- Add new topic based on chat history or support requests

### ‚ú® Example of conversation flow

Below is an example of a topic that handles vacation leave requests.

**Step 1: Trigger phrase**

User types, 
    
<samp>I want to request vacation leave</samp>

**Step 2: Agent asks for details using an Adaptive card**

Agent asks,

<samp>Sure! What dates would you like to take off?</samp>

Adaptive card has a start date and end date calendar picker control.

**Step 3: User provides dates**

User selects start date as August 5 2025 and end date August 10 2025, and submits card. Date values are stored in the output of the adaptive card as variables.

**Step 4: Cloud flow executed**

A Power Automate cloud flow has been executed which creates a new request in leave management system and sends an email to notify manager of leave request.

**Step 5: Send a confirmation message to the user**

Agent responds with,

<samp>Your vacation leave request from August 5 to August 10 has been submitted. Your manager will review and get back to you shortly.</samp>
