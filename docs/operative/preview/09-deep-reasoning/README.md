# Applying Deep Reasoning to Evaluate Candidate Fit and Interview Preparation

--8<-- "disclaimer.md"

## Theory

- Explain what deep reasoning is
- Talk about ways to use it (in the agent itself or a prompt)
- Talk about when you would use it

## Lab

For the Interview Prep agent - we'll use deep reasoning. In this case, we will reason over the following things:

- Interview questions (are there any gaps we need to zoom into during the interview)
- Outcome of Prompt on company fit (text on how this candidate aligns to the company values + score)
- Outcome of Prompt on role fit (text on how this candidate aligns to the role requirements + score)

This is a great moment to apply the advanced instructions that learners have learned about in the earlier lesson.
